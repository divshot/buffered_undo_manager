{"name":"Buffered Undo Manager","body":"# Javascript Buffered Undo Manager\r\n\r\nThis library provides a simple undo manager with update buffering\r\nto avoid a scenario where undos become data-intensive or cumbersome\r\nfor the user in scenarios with fast-changing content.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nAs of now BufferedUndoManager requires both jQuery and Underscore.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe usage of the BufferedUndoManager is straightforward:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar manager = new BufferedUndoManager();\r\n\r\nmanager.update(\"first\");\r\nmanager.update(\"second\");\r\nmanager.state; // \"second\"\r\nmanager.undo(); \r\nmanager.state; // \"first\"\r\nmanager.redo();\r\nmanager.state; // \"second\"\r\n\r\n// What if we have frequent updates, such as a keyup?\r\nmanager.update(\"t\");\r\nmanager.update(\"th\");\r\nmanager.update(\"thi\");\r\nmanager.update(\"thir\");\r\nmanager.update(\"third\");\r\nmanager.state; // \"third\"\r\nmanager.undo();\r\nmanager.state; // \"second\"\r\n\r\n// Pass the force option to trigger an update regardless of\r\n// speed.\r\nmanager.update(\"t\", {force: true});\r\nmanager.update(\"th\");\r\nmanager.undo();\r\nmanager.state; // \"t\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default the manager will buffer input for one second (the input must\r\nbecome idle for one second before another entry will be created).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can see the [Docco Docs](https://divshot.github.com/buffered_undo_manager/docs/buffered_undo_manager.html) for more in-depth API documentation.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Divshot\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
